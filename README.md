# Music Generation Using Deep-Learning
## Problem Statement
This Project focuses on generating music automatically using Recurrent Neural Network(RNN). 
We do not have to be an expert in order to generate music. Anyone can generate a decent quality music using DeepLearning.
__Task__: Our task here is to take some existing music data then train a model using this existing data. The model has to learn the patterns in music that we humans enjoy. 

## Data Source:
1. http://abc.sourceforge.net/NMD/

__We took Jigs and Hornpipes:__

## How to run the project.
# How to train the model.
In order to run the project just run the file " Music_Train.py"
You can also load weights which are in the file" Data2/Model_Weights/". There are total 9 weight files over there. Each weight file represents the epoch number.  
# How to Generate Music Sequence
Once the model is defined and weights are calculated then run "Music_Generate.py" file.
